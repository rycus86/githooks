# Githooks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rycus86/githooks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rycus86/githooks)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/rycus86/githooks/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/rycus86/githooks?branch=master)

A simple Shell script to support per-repository [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), checked into the actual repository that uses them.

To make this work, it creates hook templates that are installed into the `.git/hooks` folders automatically on `git init` and `git clone`. When one of them executes, it will try to find matching files in the `.githooks` directory under the project root, and invoke them one-by-one.

## Layout and options

Take this snippet of a project layout as an example:

```
/
└── .githooks/
    └── commit-msg/
        ├── validate
        └── add-text
    └── pre-commit/
        ├── 01-validate
        ├── 02-lint
        ├── 03-test
        ├── docs.md
        └── .ignore
    └── post-checkout
    └── ...
    └── .ignore
    └── .shared
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── ...
```

All hooks to be executed live under the `.githooks` top-level folder, that should be checked into the repository. Inside, we can have directories with the name of the hook (like `commit-msg` and `pre-commit` above), or a file matching the hook name (like `post-checkout` in the example). The filenames in the directory do not matter, but the ones starting with a `.` will be excluded by default. All others are executed in alphabetical order according to the [glob / LC_COLLATE](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/glob.html) rules. You can use the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool as `git hooks list` to list all the hooks that apply to the current repository and their current state.

## Execution

If a file is executable, it is directly invoked, otherwise it is interpreted with the `sh` shell. All parameters of the hook are passed to each of the scripts.

Hooks related to `commit` events will also have a `${STAGED_FILES}` environment variable set, that is the list of staged and changed files (according to `git diff --cached --diff-filter=ACMR --name-only`), one per line and where it makes sense (not `post-commit`). If you want to iterate over them, and expect spaces in paths, you might want to set `IFS` like this.

```shell
IFS="
"

for STAGED in ${STAGED_FILES}; do
    ...
done
```

The `ACMR` filter in the `git diff` will include staged files that are added, copied, modified or renamed.

## Supported hooks

The supported hooks are listed below. Refer to the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) for information on what they do and what parameters they receive.

- `applypatch-msg`
- `pre-applypatch`
- `post-applypatch`
- `pre-commit`
- `prepare-commit-msg`
- `commit-msg`
- `post-commit`
- `pre-rebase`
- `post-checkout`
- `post-merge`
- `pre-push`
- `pre-receive`
- `update`
- `post-receive`
- `post-update`
- `push-to-checkout`
- `pre-auto-gc`
- `post-rewrite`
- `sendemail-validate`

## Ignoring files

The `.ignore` files allow excluding files from being treated as a hook script. They allow *glob* filename patterns, empty lines and comments, where the line starts with a `#` character. In the above example, one of the `.ignore` files should contain `*.md` to exclude the `pre-commit/docs.md` Markdown file. The `.githooks/.ignore` file applies to each of the hook directories, and should still define filename patterns, `*.txt` instead of `**/*.txt` for example. If there is a `.ignore` file both in the hook type folder and in `.githooks`, the files whose filename matches any pattern from either of those two files will be excluded. You can also manage `.ignore` files using the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool, and running `git hooks ignore <pattern>`.

Hooks in individual repositories can be disabled as well, running `git hooks disable ...`, or all of them with `git hooks config set disable`, check their documentation or `help` for more information. Finally, all hook execution can be bypassed with a non-empty value in the `$GITHOOKS_DISABLE` environment variable too.

## Shared hook repositories

The hooks are primarily designed to execute programs or scripts in the `.githooks` folder of a single repository. However there are use-cases for common hooks, shared between many repositories with similar requirements and functionality. For example, you could make sure Python dependencies are updated on projects that have a `requirements.txt` file, or an `mvn verify` is executed on `pre-commit` for Maven projects, etc.

For this reason, you can place a `.shared` file inside the `.githooks` repository, which can hold a list of repositories, one per line or separated by comma, which hold common and shared hooks. Alternatively, you can have a comma-separated list of shared repositories set in the `githooks.shared` global Git configuration variable, and the hooks in these repositories will execute for all local projects where the base hooks are installed. Below is an example value for this setting.

```shell
$ git config --global --get githooks.shared
git@github.com:shared/hooks-python.git,git@github.com:shared/hooks-maven.git
$ git hooks shared list --with-url
...
```

The install script offers to set these up for you, but you can do it any time by changing the global configuration variable. These repositories will be checked out into the `~/.githooks.shared` folder, and are updated automatically after a `post-merge` event (typically a `git pull`) on any local repositories. The layout of these shared repositories is the same as above, with the exception that the hook folders (or files) can be at the project root as well, to avoid the redundant `.githooks` folder.

You can also manage and update shared hook repositories using the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool. Run `git hooks shared help` or see the tool's documentation in the `docs/` folder to see the available options.

## Opt-in hooks

To try and make things a little bit more secure, Githooks checks if any new hooks were added we haven't run before, or if any of the existing ones have changed. When they have, it will prompt for confirmation whether you accept those changes or not, and you can also disable specific hooks to skip running them until you decide otherwise. The accepted checksums are maintained in the `.git/.githooks.checksum` file, per local repository.

If the repository contains a `.githooks/trust-all` file, it is marked as a trusted repository. On the first interaction with hooks, Githooks will ask for confirmation that the user trusts all existing and future hooks in the repository, and if she does, no more confirmation prompts will be shown. This can be reverted by running either the `git config --unset githooks.trust.all`, or the `git hooks config reset trusted` command. This is a per-repository setting. These can be set up and changed with the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool as well, run `git hooks trust help` and `git hooks config help` for more information.

There is a caveat worth mentioning: if a terminal *(tty)* can't be allocated, then the default action is to accept the changes or new hooks. Let me know in an issue if you strongly disagree, and you think this is a big enough risk worth having slightly worse UX instead.

You can also accept changes to a hook using the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool, and running `git hooks accept <hook>`. See the tool's documentation in the `docs/` folder to see the available options.

### Opt-out

In a similar spirit to the opt-in above, you can also opt-out of running the hooks in the repository. You can disable executing the files per project, or globally, using the commands below.

```shell
# Disable in the current repository
$ git hooks config set disable
$ git config githooks.disable Y  # alternative
# Disable in all repositories
$ git config --global githooks.disable Y
```

Also, as mentioned above, all hook execution can be bypassed with a non-empty value in the `$GITHOOKS_DISABLE` environment variable, or per-repository, by running the `git hooks config set disable` command.

You can also selectively disable some or all of the hooks using the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool, and running `git hooks disable <hook>`. See the tool's documentation in the `docs/` folder to see the available options.

## Command line helper

Githooks will set up a Git alias for `git hooks <cmd>` for you, that enables you to print the names and state of the hooks in the current repository, and also manage them, along with some other functionality, like updating shared hook repositories, running a Githooks update, etc.

> See the documentation of the command line helper tool on its [docs page](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md)!

## Installation

The commands below fetch and execute the [install.sh](install.sh) script from this repository. It will:

1. Find out where the Git templates directory is
    1. From the `$GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR` environment variable
    2. With the `git config --get init.templateDir` command
    3. Checking the default `/usr/share/git-core/templates` folder
    4. Search on the filesystem for matching directories
    5. Offer to set up a new one, and make it `init.templateDir`
2. Set up the hook templates for the supported hooks - the templates are basically a copy of the `base-template.sh` file content
3. Offer to enable automatic update checks
4. Offer to find existing Git repositories on the filesystem (disable with `--skip-install-into-existing`)
    1. Install the hooks into them
    2. Offer to add an intro README in their `.githooks` folder
5. Offer to set up shared hook repositories

To install the templates, just execute the command below, and follow the instructions in the terminal.

```shell
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://r.viktoradam.net/githooks)"
```

If you want, you can try out what the script would do first, without changing anything.

```shell
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://r.viktoradam.net/githooks)" -- --dry-run
```

You can also run the installation in non-interactive mode with the command below. This will try to find the template directory, install the hooks automatically, and enable periodic update checks.

```shell
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://r.viktoradam.net/githooks)" -- --non-interactive
```

There is also an option to run the install script for the repository in the current directory only, without setting up the Git templates for any future repositories. For this, run the command below.

```shell
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://r.viktoradam.net/githooks)" -- --single
```

You can change this setting later with the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool, running the `git hooks config [set|reset] single` command, which affects how future updates are run, when started from the local repository.

Finally, if you trust GitHub URLs more, use the command below that skips the redirect from `r.viktoradam.net`. Also, some corporate proxies are not in favour of my Cloudflare certificates for some reason, so you might have a better chance with GitHub links in this case.

```shell
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rycus86/githooks/master/install.sh)"
```

The GitHub URL also accepts the additional parameters mentioned above, the `https://r.viktoradam.net/githooks` URL is just a redirect to the longer GitHub address.

### Required tools

Although most systems will usually have these tools (especially if you're using Git), I should mention that the project assumes the following programs to be available:

- `git`
- `awk`
- `sed`
- `grep`
- `find`

### Updates

You can update the scripts any time by running one of the install commands above. It will simply overwrite the templates with the new ones, and if you opt-in to install into existing local repositories, those will get overwritten too.

You can also enable automatic update checks during the installation, that is executed once a day after a successful commit. It downloads the latest version of the install script, and asks whether you want to install it. Automatic updates can be enabled or disabled at any time by running the command below.

```shell
# enable with either:
$ git hooks update enable
$ git config --global githooks.autoupdate.enabled Y
# disable with either:
$ git hooks update disable
$ git config --global githooks.autoupdate.enabled N
$ git config --global --unset githooks.autoupdate.enabled
```

You can also check for updates at any time by executing `git hooks update`, using the [command line helper](https://github.com/rycus86/githooks/blob/master/docs/command-line-tool.md) tool. You can also use its `git hooks config [enable|disable] update` command to enable or disable the automatic update checks.

### Uninstalling

If you want to get rid of these hooks and templates, you can execute the `uninstall.sh` script similarly to the install scripts.

```shell
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rycus86/githooks/master/uninstall.sh)"
```

This will delete the template files, optionally the installed hooks from the existing local repositories, and reinstates any previous hooks that were moved during the installation.
